# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
The goal is to uncover survival patterns, answer meaningful questions, and demonstrate practical data analysis skills.

## Dataset

- Titanic CSV dataset (public dataset)  
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)

- Background:  
  The Titanic sank in 1912, and the dataset contains information on passengers, including survival status, class, age, gender, number of siblings/spouses, and ticket details.

## Questions Addressed

1. What percentage of passengers survived?
2. What was the survival rate by passenger class?
3. What was the survival rate by gender?
4. What was the average age of survivors vs. non-survivors?
5. How many passengers traveled alone vs. with family?
6. Did embarkation port affect survival rates?
7. What was the fare distribution by class?
8. What were the top names among survivors?
9. Is there a relationship between age and survival?
10. How many passengers had missing age data?

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn

## Insights

- Overall survival rate ~38%
- Women survival rate ~74%, men ~19%
- First-class survival ~63%, third-class ~24%
- Younger passengers slightly more likely to survive
- Cherbourg embarkation port had the highest survival rate
- First-class passengers paid significantly more on average

## Future Improvements

- Impute missing age values or analyze missing data further
- Explore correlations between multiple features
- Build a machine learning model to predict survival
